    "|Formulas| All formulas which you derive need to be explained unless you use very common mathematical facts. Picture yourself as explaining your arguments to somebody who is just learning about your assignment. With other words, do not assume that the person marking your assignment knows all the background and therefore you can just write down the formulas without any explanation. It is your task to convince the reader that you know what you are doing when you derive an argument. Typeset all formulas in $\\LaTeX$.|\n",
    "| Code quality | Python code should be well structured, use meaningful identifiers for variables and subroutines, and provide sufficient comments. Please refer to the examples given in the tutorials. |\n",
    "| Code efficiency | An efficient implementation of an algorithm uses fast subroutines provided by the language or additional libraries. For the purpose of implementing Machine Learning algorithms in this course, that means using the appropriate data structures provided by Python and in numpy/scipy (e.g. Linear Algebra and random generators). |\n",
    "| Cooperation | All assignments must be done individually. Cheating and plagiarism will be dealt with in accordance with University procedures (please see the ANU policies on [Academic Honesty and Plagiarism](http://academichonesty.anu.edu.au)). Hence, for example, code for programming assignments must not be developed in groups, nor should code be shared. You are encouraged to broadly discuss ideas, approaches and techniques with a few other students, but not at a level of detail where specific solutions or implementation issues are described by anyone. If you choose to consult with other students, you will include the names of your discussion partners for each solution. If you have any questions on this, please ask the lecturer before you act. |"

    "We are interested to predict the outcome of the election in an imaginary country, called Under Some Assumptions (USA). There are four candidates for whom the citizens can **Vote** for: Bernie, Donald, Hillary, and Ted. The citizens live in four **Region**s: north, south, east and west. We have general demographic information about the people, namely: **Gender** (male, female) and **Hand**edness (right, left). Based on surveys done by an external company, we believe that the **Region** and **Gender** affects whether the people use their **Jacket**s full time, part time or never. Surprisingly, the company told us that the **Age** of their shoes (new, worn, old) depends on how often they wear their **Jacket**s. Furthermore, the **Gender** and their preferred **Hand** affects the **Colour** of their hat (white, black). Finally, surveys say that the citizens will **Vote** based on their **Region**, **Age** of their shoes and **Colour** of their hats.\n",
